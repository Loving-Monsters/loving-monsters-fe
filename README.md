Loving Monsters blends life simulators, game logic, and a splash of the supernatural to create a unique collaborative group environment. Explore custom-drawn environments, find hidden items, and become friends with our spooky NPCs! Multiple users can interact in real time and work on projects together using Loving Monster's virtual kanban board, asynchronous messaging, and one-on-one chat features.

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

### Vision

Loving Monsters will be a light hearted collaborative environment that will allow users
to work together, without it feeling like work.  Our pixilated art style, and NPC side quests
will make Loving Monsters feel more like a game than a work environment.  Virtual whiteboards
and various chat features will allow users to communicate about thier projects effciently.

### Pain Point

Remote collaboration is challanging at the best of times.  Endless video chat sessions are draining
and can make it harder to actually communicate with your teammates.  We wanted to create an 
environment where people would enjoy hanging out, with some laughs and little games along the 
way.  

### Why should I care?

Loving Monsters is an app that will make your group projects a little more fun.  Turn off that webcam,
let your hair down, and just concentrate on the work, not if you are muted.
